Capitalism is the idea that the only optimizations worth pursuing are denominated in units of currency, and solely maximize profits and growth. No other maximizations, not sustainability, health, happiness, nor self fulfillment across the entire population are in scope. We just strip mine the planet and exploit each other for mere cash. Hoarded wealth is the basest measure of a person, and we’ve built our entire society around accumulating cash.

I heard an observation a couple of weeks ago, something to the effect of, “Capitalism in its modern form was invented about 150 years ago, and it’s already caused an extinction crisis.” I’m sorry to say that I’m just a hostage to this inexorable march to our extinction, but I’m going to leave a journal chronicling what I’m observing on this journey.
